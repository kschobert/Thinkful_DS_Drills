    "# NLP Latent Semantic Analysis -- Kristofer Schobert\n",

    "Here we will use Latent Semantic Analysis to analyse Jane Austen's *Emma*. We will compare paragraphs of her novel via these methods. After using tf-idf, which finds the most useful words for distinguishing paragraphs, we will perform Singular Value Decomposition on the data to find the 130 most significant compontents. With our paragraphs expressed as a unit vector in the 130 dimensional space, we calculate a similarity matrix (which contains all possible dot products between paragarphs) and determine which paragraphs are most similar.\n",

    "This notebook is based on Thinkful's lesson on the topic. Here, we ask further questions, completes the intended challenges for the students, and discuss the process of LSA we work though this notebook."

      "\" If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence . You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct . But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . My courage rises while I write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence . You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . This was the fact . My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . I shall not discuss it here . For my temptation to _think_ it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement . Had she refused , I should have gone mad . But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ? What did you look forward to ? To any thing , every thing  to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of . See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls ; and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _you_ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father ' s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation . A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to . My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought . In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown . I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object  but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on . Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish . She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so . Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I cannot say ; when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree . She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . I cannot doubt it . You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs . Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax . I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself . Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account . Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her . The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself . No description can describe her . She must tell you herself what she is  yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit . Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her . She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend . I want to have your opinion of her looks . I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars . Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . If I could but see her again ! But I must not propose it yet . My uncle has been too good for me to encroach . I must still add to this long letter . You have not heard all that you ought to hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose . I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement . But I had no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman  Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself . I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be . It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully . And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable . _She_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough . My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient . She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold . But she was always right . If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known . We quarrelled . Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell ? _There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable . Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ? Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected . I was mad enough , however , to resent . I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W ., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me . In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances . I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs . Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known . ` Jane ,' indeed ! You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with me , I shall soon have done . She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again . _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ . This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death . I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness . I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and  may I add ? too cheerful in my views to be captious . We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned ! and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at : in short , the full direction to Mr . Smallridge ' s , near Bristol , stared me in the face . I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me . Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post . What was to be done ? One thing only . I must speak to my uncle . Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again . I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done . I felt that it would be of a different sort . Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake ? No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks . I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone . I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away . But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before . A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her . If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion . Miss W . calls me the child of good fortune . I hope she is right . In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F . C . WESTON CHURCHILL .    0.656723\n",
      "\" Very well , I am much obliged to you . My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night . How is Mr . Woodhouse ? I am so glad to hear such a good account . Mrs . Weston told me you were here . Oh ! then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her  and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .` Aye , pray do ,' said Mr . Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse ' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .'  But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .` Oh ,' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job ;' For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ' s spectacles . The rivet came out , you know , this morning . So very obliging ! For my mother had no use of her spectacles  could not put them on . And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs . Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always  I have heard some people say that Mrs . Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it cannot be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us . besides dear Jane at present  and she really eats nothing  makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats  so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr . Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before  I have so often heard Mr . Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr .

      "A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related . Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports : but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for \" such things ,\" he observed , \" always got about .\" Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so . They had gone , in short  and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter  who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene . They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them . Miss Fairfax ' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs . Weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , Mrs . Weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject . Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr . Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement . Mrs . Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .

      "\" I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of . Oh ! my mother ' s spectacles . So very obliging of Mr . Frank Churchill ! ` Oh !' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively .'  Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . . Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing . . . . I do congratulate you , Mrs . Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could . . . . ` Oh !' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively .' I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh !' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life .' That , you know , was so very . . . . And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs . Wallis does them full justice  only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr . Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times  but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell  some of Mr . Knightley ' s most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees  I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day  for Mr . Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ` I am sure you must be ,' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .' So I begged he would not  for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left  it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me  No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all  and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ' s profit than any thing ; but Mrs . Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs . Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr . Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very . . . . I wanted to keep it from Jane ' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware .\"

      "The persons to be invited , required little thought . Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; so far it was all of course  and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth : but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet ' s begging to be allowed to decline it . \" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home .\" It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing . She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend  for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth , Jane Fairfax . Since her last conversation with Mrs . Weston and Mr . Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been . Mr . Knightley ' s words dwelt with her . He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs . Elton which nobody else paid her .

      "Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma . That Emma was his object appeared indisputable . Every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father ' s hints , his mother - in - law ' s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story . But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr . Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax .

      "The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the \" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened !\" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation . As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell . \" She had set out from Mrs . Goddard ' s half an hour ago  she had been afraid it would rain  she had been afraid it would pour down every moment  but she thought she might get to Hartfield first  she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford ' s .\"  Ford ' s was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher ' s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place .\" And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps  when , all of a sudden , who should come in  to be sure it was so very odd ! but they always dealt at Ford ' s  who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother ! Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door  Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door ! Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there . Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse  well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me ( do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ?)  for presently she came forward  came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said  I was in such a tremble ! I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away  and then  only think ! I found he was coming up towards me too  slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered  and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ' t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr . Cole ' s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables  I believe I did  but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again .\"

She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost . She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago . How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable ! The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma . How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment  less acknowledged by Mr . Weston than by herself  but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying \" Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way .\" But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future . It was all right , all open , all equal . No sacrifice on any side worth the name . It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it .

      "\" In one respect , perhaps , Mr . Elton ' s manners are superior to Mr . Knightley ' s or Mr . Weston ' s . They have more gentleness . They might be more safely held up as a pattern . There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr . Weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good - humour with it  but that would not do to be copied . Neither would Mr . Knightley ' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr . Elton as a model . Mr . Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late . I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you . Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ?\"

      "1 \" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me .\"\n",
      "2 \" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else  which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . What has he to do with books ? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time  and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ .\"\n",
      "3 To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up  her hand seized  her attention demanded , and Mr . Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . It really was so . Without scruple  without apology  without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all . Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied ,\n",
      "4 Emma smiled and answered \" My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . Mr . Perry has been with her , as you probably heard .\"\n",
      "5 A very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial . Mr . Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , \" It was time to go ;\" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave .\n",
      "6 \" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ,\" replied Emma , smiling ; \" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time  and not very distant either  when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?\"\n",
      "7 \" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so .\"\n",
      "8 Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly . Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs . Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse ' s presiding ; Mr . Knightley ' s answer was the most distinct .\n",
      "9 \" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all \" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , \" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were  how it might all be behind the scenes . I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be .\"\n"

This is brilliant indeed ! This is admirable ! Excellently contrived , upon my word . Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it . So well lighted up ! Jane , Jane , look ! did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr . Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ' s lamp . Good Mrs . Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ` Oh ! Mrs . Stokes ,' said I  but I had not time for more .\" She was now met by Mrs . Weston . \" Very well , I thank you , ma ' am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache ! seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs . Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage ! excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment . Most comfortable carriage . Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs . Weston , on that score . Mrs . Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been . But two such offers in one day ! Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma ' am .' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr . Woodhouse ' s . I made her take her shawl  for the evenings are not warm  her large new shawl  Mrs . Dixon ' s wedding - present . So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know  Mr . Dixon ' s choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet ? It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid : but Mr . Frank Churchill was so extremely  and there was a mat to step upon  I shall never forget his extreme politeness . Oh ! Mr . Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother ' s spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane ? Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ? Ah ! here ' s Miss Woodhouse . Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ? Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land ! Such a transformation ! Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently ) that would be rude  but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look  how do you like Jane ' s hair ? You are a judge . She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair ! No hairdresser from London I think could . Ah ! Dr . Hughes I declare  and Mrs . Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr . and Mrs . Hughes for a moment . How do you do ? How do you do ? Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it ? Where ' s dear Mr . Richard ? Oh ! there he is . Don ' t disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr . Richard ? I saw you the other day as you rode through the town  Mrs . Otway , I protest ! and good Mr .

      "They had a very fine day for Box Hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party . Mr . Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time . Emma and Harriet went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback . Mrs . Weston remained with Mr . Woodhouse . Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there . Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency . There was a languor , a want of spirits , a want of union , which could not be got over . They separated too much into parties . The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill . And Mr . Weston tried , in vain , to make them harmonise better . It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied . Mr . and Mrs . Elton , indeed , shewed no unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they could ; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of separation , between the other parties , too strong for any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or any cheerful Mr . Weston , to remove .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.664905\n",

Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.644696\n",
      "Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of  and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon . Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . It was almost enough to make her think of marrying . Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change . Mr . Weston might be his son ' s superior . In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her . She was more disturbed by Mr . Knightley ' s not dancing than by any thing else . There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing , not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up , so young as he looked ! He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him . He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble . Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better . He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid . There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.635543\n",
      "\" Ah ! Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are ! I suppose you have heard  and are come to give us joy . This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me ( twinkling away a tear or two ) but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning : such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs . Dixon . ` My dear ,' said I , ` you will blind yourself ' for tears were in her eyes perpetually . One cannot wonder , one cannot wonder . It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate  such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out  do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune ( again dispersing her tears ) but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . When one is in great pain , you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . She is as low as possible . To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you  she is not able  she is gone into her own room  I want her to lie down upon the bed . ` My dear ,' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her . You were kept waiting at the door  I was quite ashamed  but somehow there was a little bustle  for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ` It is only Mrs . Cole ,' said I , ` depend upon it . Nobody else would come so early .' ` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .' But then Patty came in , and said it was you . ` Oh !' said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her .'  ` I can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting  and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ` If you must go , my dear ,' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed .'\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.631003\n",
      "It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ' s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness  and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield . A note was written to urge it . The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message . \" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ;\" and when Mr . Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs . Smallridge ' s at the time proposed . Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged  appetite quite gone  and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr . Perry was uneasy about her . He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it . Her spirits seemed overcome . Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder : confined always to one room ; he could have wished it otherwise  and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great . He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . To take her  be it only an hour or two  from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name  mentioning that she had Mr . Perry ' s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient . The answer was only in this short note :                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.624236\n",
      "Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of \" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ? Absurd and insufferable !\"  Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs . Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr . Elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to . She heard enough to know that Mr . Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words \" my son ,\" and \" Frank ,\" and \" my son ,\" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr . Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.623440\n",

Churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! How well you put it on ! so gratified ! Excellent dancing indeed ! Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me . I set off without saying a word , just as I told you . Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr . Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon . Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh !' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr . George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr . Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr . William Cox .' My dear sir , you are too obliging . Is there nobody you would not rather ? I am not helpless . Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other ! Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs . Elton is going ; dear Mrs . Elton , how elegant she looks ! Beautiful lace ! Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening ! Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one . Well , I was persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style  Candles everywhere . I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane , There was a little disappointment . The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr . Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus  so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned ! Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing ! Such elegance and profusion ! I have seen nothing like it since  Well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where _I_ sit is of no consequence . Oh ! do you recommend this side ? Well , I am sure , Mr . Churchill  only it seems too good  but just as you please . What you direct in this house cannot be wrong . Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? Soup too !

Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . Mr . Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr .

      "0 Mr . Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it . The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .\n",
      "1 \" Oh ! no  none in the least . I never saw Mrs . Weston better in my life  never looking so well . Papa is only speaking his own regret .\"\n",
      "2 \" Oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , I am persuaded . You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment .\"\n",
      "3 Such was Jane Fairfax ' s history . She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ' s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters . Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with . Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it . The evil day was put off . It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over .\n",
      "4 \" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season .\"\n",
      "5 \" And I am quite serious too , I assure you ,\" replied Mrs . Elton gaily , \" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us .\"\n",
      "6 \" And here is Mrs . Weston and Mr . Frank Churchill too ! Quite delightful ; so many friends !\"\n",
      "7 \" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ,\" said Jane , \" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs . Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am .\"\n",
      "8 Harriet , Mr . Elton , and Mr . Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ; the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr . Woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .\n",
      "9 \" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ' s sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr . Dixon , one may guess what one chuses .\"\n"

He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else  which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . What has he to do with books ?

    "It would be need to see how similar and different certain chapters of a book are. Does the book have a stark contrast between to adjacent chapters? This would be a sudden change in the book, like some dramatic shift in the story. Maybe something goes terribly wrong in a previously happy city. I'm definitely interesting in the path a novel takes from beginning to end. What is the trajectory of a novel be in an LSA landscape?"
