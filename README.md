# Thinkful_DS_Drills
Drills from Thinkful's Data Science Bootcamp

Here, I have uploaded my drills for Thinkful's Data Science Bootcamp. Many of these assignments contain rough, uneditted work.  My intention for uploading these assignments is not to showcase my capabilities. Uploading assignments to this github repository is the way in which I submit my Thinkful drills and smaller assignments.

For a proper representation of my work, please see my Capstone Projects.
