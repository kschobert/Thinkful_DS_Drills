--Here we have the top 5 most expensive rooms. The winner is a 9270 euro ($10,563) private room in the Hietzing
--neighborhood of Vienna. It is described in its title as a "20qm" room. qm == m^2. qm is a German shorthand.

--After looking at the page for this room on airbnb.com, I am growing suspicious of this price being legitimate.
--Joe's room is not worth this large amount of money per night. It's just one of many rooms in a unit shared with Joe's
--roomates. Joe has received many positive reviews online, leading me to believe he may have changed the price to something
--ridiculous after deciding he would not have people stay in his room. No one has left a review since 2015.
